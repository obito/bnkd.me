The main goal of TF1 is to provide innovative broadcasting solutions as France's leading television network, connecting millions of viewers through engaging content and advertising.

During my freelance engagement on TF1's Pub Team, I contributed significantly across various core platforms:


# WizAds – Ad Delivery Platform

Developed WizAds, an advanced ad proxy responsible for connecting TF1's devices—apps, IPTV, and Connected TVs—to our primary ad providers. WizAds enriches ad requests with essential tracking data and partner-specific information, significantly enhancing reliability and performance of ad deliveries across all platforms.

# TV Segmentée (TVS)


I was actively involved in the development of TF1's TV Segmentée, a targeted advertising solution that personalizes viewer experiences based on various demographic and geographic criteria. This approach significantly improved ad engagement by providing relevant content to segmented audiences.

# WizAds Backoffice

Enhanced the backoffice platform for WizAds, enabling régisseurs to autonomously manage channels and customize ad-proxy behaviors. This tool significantly streamlined internal processes and reduced operational overhead.

# Wizfy – End-to-End Testing Framework

Built and implemented Wizfy, a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework. Using a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) proxy, Wizfy enabled precise validation of all ad-proxy and microservice behaviors, ensuring robust and error-free performance across TF1's infrastructure.

# Adventory – Ad Management and Billing Platform

Developed and refined Adventory, a unified platform managing both streaming and segmented TV ads. Adventory automated billing processes and campaign management, significantly simplifying ad sales workflows.

When a brand aims to advertise on TF1, our sales team leverages Adventory. They specify detailed campaign criteria—such as geographical targeting, demographics, device types, time frames, and budgets. Adventory then instantly generates precise quotes, including total impressions, daily budgets, and accurate CPM (Cost Per Mille), streamlining the process for both TF1 and its advertising partners.
